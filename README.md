# hello-world
Not quite as good as cautious succotash, but it's a start!

I am scared and life is complex and so is this assignment AND I've never used GitHub before.
Sometimes I just want to crawl into a dark hole somewhere but
I also feel like there's a lot out there worth striving for so
I want to take a real shot at succeeding at this.
I believe I'm capable of doing it, it'll just be really difficult and uncomfortable.
Anyway, hi! I also like cats.
